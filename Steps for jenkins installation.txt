1) Prepare the Environment
System Requirements: Jenkins requires Java (JDK 8 or 11) and runs on many operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Install Java: Ensure Java is installed and set up in your system:

2) Download the Jenkins Windows installer from jenkins.io.
   Run the installer and follow the installation prompts.

3) Start Jenkins Service

4) Access Jenkins
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (replace localhost with the server’s IP if accessing remotely).

5) Setup Jenkins
Once logged in, Jenkins will prompt you to install plugins.
Choose Install Suggested Plugins (recommended for basic setup) or select specific plugins based on your requirements.
Create your first admin user and complete the setup.

6) Configure Basic Settings
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System to set up system-wide configurations, such as:
Jenkins URL
Email notifications
JDK, Git, and other tool paths

7) Install and Configure Plugins
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins and install any necessary plugins for your project. Some commonly used plugins:
Git Plugin: For integrating with Git repositories.
Pipeline Plugin: For creating CI/CD pipelines as code.
Blue Ocean: For a modern UI and pipeline visualization.

8) Create Your First Job
Go to New Item on the Jenkins dashboard.
Choose a project type (Freestyle Project or Pipeline).
Configure the job:
Set up a source control repository, like GitHub.
Add build steps, such as shell scripts or Maven commands.
Add post-build actions, like sending email notifications.

9) Run and Test the Job
Trigger the job manually or set up automatic triggers like Build Periodically or Poll SCM to pull code at regular intervals.
Check the Console Output to monitor build logs.

10) Configure Security and User Permissions
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security to set up security:
Choose an authentication method, like Jenkins’ internal database.
Configure authorization options to control user permissions.

11) Setting Up Backups (Optional but Recommended)
Use the ThinBackup plugin or another backup method to regularly back up Jenkins configurations, jobs, and plugins.
After setup, you can start exploring CI/CD pipelines, automating tests, and deploying applications through Jenkins!
